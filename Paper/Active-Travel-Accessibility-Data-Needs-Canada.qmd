## Abstract

Active travel is a key element to achieve robust and healthy urban transportation policies. As the analysis of transportation needs in cities shifts from a focus on mobility to accessibility, the need to assess accessibility by cycling and walking has become increasingly pressing. The distinguishing features of these modes---lower speeds, shorter trips, and potentially different purposes compared to motorized trips---mean that the data inputs required for accessibility analysis are not necessarily the same as those used for the study of accessibility for motorized travel. The objective of this review is to assess the sources of data and data needs to implement active accessibility analysis. Walking-specific and cycling-specific geographic accessibility measures and data applied within recently published literature are reviewed. Walking and cycling accessibility measures are compared in terms of the types of metrics, the origins and destinations considered, geographic scales, and travel time or distance calculations. In comparing approaches for walking versus cycling, this report also highlights possible considerations, challenges, and questions that emerge when considering the future of active travel accessibility-based analysis. The discussion in this review is centered on the Canadian context, but the lessons may be more broadly applicable to other national contexts.

## Introduction

For decades, transportation planning has been focused on providing mobility for the private car, which was first introduced in North America as a solution to problems caused by rapid urbanization and later copied elsewhere [@angotti1996latin; @brown2009planning]. However, it is now clear that mobility centered on the private car is inefficient, inequitable, and unsustainable, requiring immediate attention. This includes environmental issues such as climate change [@chapman2007transport], as well as numerous other social [@boschmann2008toward; @lucas2012transport; @lucas2019new], health [@khreis2016health; @milne2012public], and equity concerns [@bocarejo2012transport; @martens2012justice; @pereira2017distributive].To reduce car use, the transportation agenda has aimed to focus on the creation of mobility polycultures that offer a broader menu of transportation alternatives [@lavery2013driving; @millera2011]. Polycultures are resilient and adaptable systems with numerous mobility options, including mobility substitutes such as information technologies. This is more complex than a monoculture, as it requires not only a broader range of mobility technologies but also a much higher level of coordination among modes and travelers. Therefore, active travel, such as walking and cycling, is a key component of efforts in urban areas as they try to achieve more robust and healthy urban transportation polycultures [@millera2011; @lavery2013driving; @lira2021].

Cycling and walking are effective modes for short- and mid-range travel in urban areas that have, over a period of decades, grown to accommodate travel by automobile [@brown2009; @wiersma2020] while treating other modes almost as afterthoughts [@brezina2020; @koglin2020; @ruffino2021].On the one hand, there are concerns about the externalities of the current (car-centeric) transportation system; on the other hand, there is a growing understanding and awareness of the numerous co-benefits of active mobility in terms of health, efficiency, and social inclusion [@banister2005unsustainable; @garling2014handbook; @gossling2019social; @mueller2015health]. Along with a focus on motorized travel, the focus of transportation planning has been to plan for mobility mainly by car. Transportation and land use systems have been designed to produce mobility, and this is reflected in the use of measures of efficiency that ignore the reason for most travel, which is to reach destinations [@handy1997measuring].

The idea of producing mobility seems intuitive when planning for inexpensive motorized travel, in an era when automobile users have been, as a matter of policy, shielded from paying --and even becoming aware-- of the full cost of their travel [@taylor2006]. In recognition of the contradiction of trying to generate mobility while also hoping to reduce the ill effects of mobility, an argument in the transportation literature for decades has been to shift from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning [@handy1997measuring; @unit2003]. Transportation accessibility is commonly defined as the potential of transportation-land use systems to generate access to opportunities [@paez2012] and conceptually strikes at the heart of wasteful mobility-based planning by focusing on the ability to reach destinations. Despite mixed evidence regarding the adoption of accessibility in planning practice [@boisjoly2017; @proffitt2019] there are reasons to believe that the future belongs to accessibility-based planning [@handy2020].

The relevance of accessibility-based planning is even more evident when active modes are considered: who would rather make long trips if equivalent destinations could be reached with shorter trips? Not only can pedestrians and cyclists not be shielded from the cost of travel, the effort of reaching destinations is inherently visceral [@hsu2014; @iseki2014; @paez2020]. As interest in active travel-based accessibility (ATB accessibility) grows globally [@arranz2019; @li2020; @ortega2021evaluating; @rosas2020], transportation scholars have built on decades-worth of accessibility research that mainly focused on motorized travel. In principle, accessibility analysis is sufficiently general to be applicable for ATB accessibility analysis. In practice, it is important to recognize the differences between motorized and active travel, and how they can impact their implementation with a focus on active travel [@iacono2010]. Active modes of transportation absorbed the interest of researchers because they have significant implications and combines unrivalled advantages such as environment, health, and social inclusion [@pucher2010walking; @rojas2011health; @rojas2012replacing; @otero2018health; @koszowski2019active; @tinessa2021walkability]. They have been linked to a variety of health benefits. For example, they improve longevity [@hakim1998effects], cognitive function [@weuve2004physical], quality of life [@strawbridge1996successful; @leveille1999aging], and are perceived as cleaner and more efficient sustainable modes of transportation [@bhopal1995cycling]. They also become an excellent alternative for mobility, lowering transportation costs for families, promoting gender equality, building resilient structures, and contributing to the aesthetic value of the environment [@koszowski2019active]. They also improve accessibility for those who do not have other modes of transportation and aid in the development of local and regional economies. However, compared to motorized travel, active travel is slower, occurs on smaller scales, has less safety due to their higher risk of being severely injured in collisions than motorized vehicle drivers, is used to reach potentially different destinations, and involves costs, such as physical effort, that are typically ignored in motorized travel analysis [@ng2017cyclist; @akgun2018cyclist; @pokorny2018conflicts; @oehl2019cyclists; @useche2019healthy].

The objective of the present study is to investigate ATB accessibility with a focus on data sources and needs, using Canada as case study. The research is prompted by a recent Canadian project that has been tasked with developing data-driven standards for the analysis of transportation equity. The need to propose methods that can be used consistently across regions requires a sound understanding of how analysis and outputs can be conditioned by the data inputs. it is important to acknowledge that other reviews of ATB accessibility measures exist [@geurs2004; @iacono2010; @maghelal2011; @talen2013; @vale2016active]. The contribution of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature by focusing on the data required by various measures of ATB accessibility and comparing measures that can be implemented consistently in different contexts, as well as data needs for consistent implementation of the rest.

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a background of methods. Section 3 presents methods for ATB accessibility analysis, section 4 provides a categorization of the required data according to each of the accessibility measurements. Section 5 provides Important considerations and possible challenges for calculating accessibility by active mode; discussions and conclusions are provided in Section 6.

## Background

Transportation planning has emerged as a distinct field centered primarily on mobility, defined as the ease of movement. Mobility indicators such as travel speed and travel time were proposed in this context, with a focus on motorized transportation [@banister2008sustainable]. The concept of accessibility has long been adopted in both spatial and transportation research to assess the quality and extent of the relationships between spatial development of a certain area and the transportation system serving it. The seminal work of Hansen (1959) defined accessibility as "the potential of opportunities for interaction", measuring the number and variety of opportunities which can be obtained from a specific location by means of the transportation system.As a result of Hansen's work, researchers began to emphasize the importance of including accessibility as a performance indicator in land use and transportation plans as an alternative to mobility-based transportation planning [@koenig1980indicators; @morris1979accessibility; @wachs1973physical]. Furthermore, the researchers argued that improved access reflects the network's economic and social benefits, specifically in terms of land value and quality of life [@koenig1980indicators; @wachs1973physical]. Recently, accessibility has been promoted as a critical component of land use and transportation planning, specifically in terms of social equity, economic development, and environmental impacts [@banister2008sustainable; @handy2002accessibility; @lucas2012transport; @preston2007accessibility]. For example, in 2004, Geurs and van Wee deconstructed the concept of accessibility into four elements: (i) **Land use** describes the quality, quantity, and spatial distribution of opportunities as destination places, such as schools, jobs, hospitals, and recreational facilities, as well as demand for opportunities at origin places; (ii) **Transportation** refers to the transportation system represented by the disutility for a person to travel from an origin to a destination using a specific mode of transportation; (iii) **Time**, which accounts for the time constraints in terms of the availability of opportunities throughout the day and the time available for people to take advantage of such opportunities; and iv) **Individual**, which indicates specific (groups of) people's capabilities (determined by income, education level, travel mode availability, etc.) and needs (determined by age, household situation, etc.).

Mobility-based approaches emphasize travel time reduction, whereas accessibility planning aims to provide all individuals with a reasonable travel time to a variety of destinations. As a result, accessibility planning prioritizes active and public transportation and incorporates land use policies that shorten distances between activities[@banister2008sustainable].Accessibility refers to the ease of access to different destinations which are valuable and can be reached. In order to calculate accessibility, the implementation of access measures varies depending on the research need, mode of transport, data need, activities, and land use pattern, as well as the costs of travel over the transport infrastructure that connects it. So, the emphasis on different elements of accessibility has resulted in multiple measurement methods and indicators [for example, @geurs2004; @kelobonye2019relative; @lee2010reexamining; @neutens2015accessibility; @paez2010accessibility; @vandenbulcke2009mapping], including proximity, cumulative, gravity, utility-based, and space-time prism models as the dominant approaches. However, there are disagreements about how to evaluate this concept [@castiglione2006application; @fan2012impact; @wang2015gis].

In general, accessibility can be measured at the individual-based or locational level (place-based) [@miller2005place]. Indeed, place-based metrics are concerned with the land use and transportation components, and focus on the physical separation of key locations, say an origin and potential destinations.Cumulative-opportunity accessibility and gravity accessibility are examples of this category. This kind of accessibility refers to the degree to which people can reach and use services, amenities, and opportunities located in a specific geographic location, such as a neighborhood, city, or region.On the other hand, individual-based metrics take into account some representation of the space-time behavior of individuals and refers to the degree to which an individual person can reach and use services, amenities, and opportunities based on their personal characteristics, such as age, gender, income, mobility, and health status.Space-time accessibility and utility accessibility belong to this category. Individual-based accessibility considers the unique needs and preferences of individuals, including their ability to access different types of transportation, travel routes, and modes of transportation. Individuals-based accessibility is sometimes included in location-based studies by stratifying the population by age group or socioeconomic characteristics, as well as by segmenting destinations [@harris2001accessibility; @vale2009sustainable; @paez2010accessibility; @fan2012impact; @legrain2015and; @legrain2016travelling].These two approaches are related, and individual-based measures can in fact be seen as a special case of placed-based measures, where the impedance function and cost are a constant by destinations.

The use of location-based accessibility has the significant advantage of being easily computed[@bhat2000urban].for calculating placed-based accessibility, researchers require data such as average travel time between two points, population data, and aggregated activity data.As a result, cumulative-opportunity accessibility is one of the most widely used methods of calculating accessibility.Following that, space-time accessibility assesses how individuals can carry out desired activities while facing constraints[@miller1991modelling; @kwan1998; @lee1998application]. This framework is based on Hagerstrand's (1970) time geography model.He discussed three factors that influence individual accessibility. Capability constraint means that people can only do things when they are awake. People cannot go wherever they want because travel impediment exists at all times. Coupling is the second and most important constraint. People must perform specific tasks at specific times.People, for example, may remain at their workplace during working hours (e.g. 8 AM to 5 PM). The final constraint is the authority constraint. This constraint includes activity opening hours. People, for example, cannot use a park late at night because it is closed. The number of activities that can be performed under various constraints is measured by space-time accessibility[@ilagcrstrand1970people].According to this study, space-time accessibility (i.e. person-based accessibility) is a better measurement than cumulative-opportunity accessibility (i.e. place-based accessibility) because it captures individuals' actual travel behavior. This is due to the fact that space-time accessibility takes into account temporal variations in transportation systems and activities, as well as individuals' unique travel behavior. In other words, because place-based accessibility does not fully address temporal constraints, it may be inaccurate when measuring accessibility.

On the one hand, space-time accessibility takes into account temporal variations in transportation and activities[@fransen2015identifying; @boisjoly2017]. In place-based accessibility, temporal variations in transportation systems have been ignored. Travel time between two points varies depending on the time of day because traffic volume varies. However, average daily travel time is used in place-based accessibility.

On the other hand, space-time accessibility considers temporal variations in activities. Place-based accessibility assumes that all activities are carried out during hours chosen at random by researchers. However, activities are only available during their regular business hours.

To write a general formula for accessibility for active transportation modes, we can modify the formula, by taking into account factors that are specific to active transportation. Here is one possible formula:

$$
A^{pk}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{J} g(O^k_j) f(c^p_{ij})
$$ {#eq-general-accessibility}

With functions for the opportunities that allow this formulation: $$
g(O_j) = O_j
$$ {#eq-opportunities-function}

\noindent as well as possibly agglomeration effects as in: $$
g(O_j) = O^\alpha_j
$$ {#eq-agglomeration-effects}

This kind of accessibility measure was obtained from Hansen, 1959,which measures accessibility by the number of opportunities reachable via an impedance (or spatial decay) function.The impedance function reduces opportunities as travel costs rise (time, money, etc.).The impedance function computes using a variety of formulas, including negative power, exponential, lognormal, and log-logistic (@hansen1959accessibility; @ingram1971concept; @reggiani2011accessibility; @geurs2003evaluation; @vale2016active).A_i, O_j, and C_ij in this formula represent matrices of accessibility opportunities and costs, respectively. Following the development of @levinson2020towards, the functions (g and f) discount opportunities and costs based on diminishing value of opportunities with both number and cost.In principle, the matrix of weighted opportunities (O_j) can take into account different activity types, times of day, and all available modes, as well as the matrix of all relevant cost elements (C_ij), which may be the full social costs or generalized internal costs, depending on the purpose.

The decay function's cumulative opportunities (rectangular) formulation is as follows: $$
f(c^p_{ij}) =
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } c^p_{ij} \le \gamma^p \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-impedance-function}

In addition, The widely used exponential decay formulation in gravity models is frequently given by @eq-exponential-distance-decay: $$
f(c^p_{ij}) = exp(-\theta c^p_{ij})
$$ {#eq-exponential-distance-decay}

Generally, close opportunities are preferred over distant ones [@miller2004tobler], and fewer trips are made between distant locations than between nearby ones[@ingram1971concept].As a result, interaction is less likely in remote locations. In most cases, travel impedance functions are calibrated using observed trip likelihood or trip rate data from travel surveys[@geurs2001accessibility; @ingram1971concept].So, the impedance functions show reduced interaction between places. The trip rates can be used to calibrate the travel impedance function (f (C\_{ij})).

Individual-based accessibility in active mode (e.g., walking, cycling) can also be difficult to calculate due to a variety of factors. Some of the major constraints for calculating individual-based accessibility in active mode are as follows:

1.  Individual preferences for modes of transportation can have a significant impact on accessibility. Some people prefer to walk or ride their bikes, while others prefer to take public transportation or drive. Factors such as distance, time, safety, and comfort can all have an impact on personal preferences.

2.  Physical ability: Similar to place-based accessibility, personal physical ability can greatly impact individual-based accessibility in active mode. People with disabilities or health issues may find it difficult or impossible to travel by foot or bike, reducing their accessibility.

3.  Time constraints: In order to save time, people may choose faster modes of transportation such as driving or taking public transportation, reducing accessibility in active modes. While individual-based accessibility is measured, it should be recognized that every individual has a different opportunity set available [@miller1991modelling]. Effectively, the available time threshold (t) varies for each person as a function of individual constraints, such as time of day, purpose, and so on. Constraints arise for a number of reasons. Time geography acknowledges that spatial and temporal characteristics limit an individual's choice of activities [@chi2013impact; @pred1977choreography; @miller1991modelling; @miller2009field]. Time constraints can be visualized using a time-space diagram, the size of which is determined by both the amount of time available and the performance of the transportation system [@ilagcrstrand1970people]. The space-time prism accounts for an individual's activity schedule and can be used to measure access to multiple activities and activity participation time using simple behavioral rules [@miller1991modelling]. Accessibility is measured by the total number of opportunities available within the space-time prism encompassing all possible paths under the time constraint [@tong2015transportation]. So, while opportunities may be spatially accessible, the amount of time available in a day for people to reach and engage in these activities is limited. This line of thought leads to the constraints-based or people-based accessibility measure[@wu2001computational].

4.  Weather conditions, like place-based accessibility, can have an impact on individual-based accessibility in active mode. In extreme weather, people may be less likely to walk or cycle, reducing their ability to choose these modes.

5.  Infrastructure: The quality and availability of infrastructure such as sidewalks, bike lanes, and pedestrian crossings can greatly impact individual-based accessibility in active mode. People may be less likely to choose active modes of transportation in areas with poor infrastructure, reducing there ability to choose these modes.

Accessibility measures in active modes include activity-based measures, distance-based, topological or infrastructure-based measures, utility-based measures, as well as, walkability, and bikeability. Activity-based measures (includes gravity-based and cumulative opportunities measures) are based on the gravity model and weight opportunities according to a travel impedance function and the accessibility of a place is assessed as the combined effect of the size of opportunities and the cost of traveling to them. Distance-based measures analyze the closest facilities and include: 1) distance to the closest opportunity, 2) the number of opportunities within a defined distance or time, 3) the mean distance to all opportunities, and 4) the mean distance to a defined number of closest opportunities. Infrastructur -based measures are based exclusively on features of the street and transportation network and are insensitive to the location of activities in space. utility-based measures (also designated benefit measures) are developed from microeconomic random utility theory and describe accessibility as the result of a (rational) choice from a set of destination transportation alternatives [@kwan1998; @halden2000accessibility; @geurs2001accessibility; @apparicio2008comparing]. Walkability and bikeability measure the number of people, households or jobs distributed over a unit of area or measures how many types---offices, housing, retail, entertainment, services, and so on---are located in a given area [@frank2003health; @leslie2007walkability]. Indeed, using accurate accessibility measures for walking or cycling trips can assist transport planners in making more rational decisions in infrastructure provision for non-motorized transportation [@iacono2010; @devkota2012planning].

Moreover, calculating ATB accessibility in both approaches requires multiple data sets relating to travel behavior and land use. Unfortunately, this has suffered from a lack of appropriate data[@iacono2010]. In particular, little information is available on the geography of walking and cycling behavior such as travel episode origins and destinations, routes, and lengths (durations and distances). So, in most cases, required data is obtained from local/national questionnaires and local maps [@iacono2010; @levine2010zoned; @devkota2012planning; @yang2012walking; @millward2013active] . In addition, available data are extremely location specific or cover a small geographic area and are not adequately covered in most large-scale survey instruments, such as national transportation survey [@ulmer2003evaluating; @achuthan2007measuring].

## Methods for ATB accessibility analysis

Measures of ATB accessibility can either be location-based, focusing on the distances to opportunities from particular locations, or individual-based, taking into account the limitations of people's time and space. Vale et al (2016) categorized location-based accessibility measures into four main groups: first, activity-based, which includes gravity-based (also designated attraction-accessibility or potential) and cumulative opportunities measures (also known as isochrones or contour measures). In addition, these measures have been widely used in non-motorized accessibility studies [@iacono2010; @lowry2012assessment; @millward2013active; @prins2014many; @li2020]; second, topology infrastructure-based, which include topological measures of the network [@hull2012accessibility; @lundberg2012accessibility]; third, distance-based, which include analyses of the closest facilities [@apparicio2008comparing; @sadler2011application], and the last category being utility-based measures which are also known as benefits measures [@geurs2004; @hunt2007influences; @vale2009sustainable; @el2011place].

One important reason why location-based measures are widely used instead of individual-based measures for active transport modes is their potential compatibility with regional travel forecasting models. These models rely on data from various sources to predict travel patterns and demands across different areas. By using location-based measures, such as coded networks, it becomes easier to extract travel times and distances between one area to another [@iacono2010; @saghapour2017measuring].

There are some limitations of using location-based measures for active travel modes. first, active travel modes are less sensitive to travel times and levels of network congestion rather than motorized modes. as well, walking and cycling route choices tend to include qualitative, experiential, or difficult to measure factors [@hunt2007influences; @tilahun2007trails; @iacono2010]. second, measuring active transport accessibility is mostly dependent on travel diary data. besides, The methods applied so far to measure cycling accessibility have not focused on the accessibility of cycling destinations in terms of service areas [@landis1997real; @harkey1998development; @harkey1998Development; @landis2003intersection]. some studies have investigated the level of services such as Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI) or Bicycle Level of Service (BLOS) for a bicycle network. indeed, these measures focused on measuring the performance of a bicycle network using various geometric measures such as the width of the bicycle routes, pavement, route types, and connectivity. Nonetheless, there are other methods that consider bikeability in terms of how accessible different destinations are for bicycles as a transport mode. Such methods measure the potential for cycling using travel behaviour data [@espada2011application; @wahlgren2012exploring; @rybarczyk2014measuring; @milakis2015people].

##### Activity-based measures

Activity-based measures include both gravity-based (also known as Hansen-type [@hansen1959accessibility] and cumulative opportunities measures. Gravity-based measures designated attraction --accessibility or potential and consider the number of opportunities weighted by the cost of traveling to them -- using a travel impedance function that values closer opportunities higher. Researchers underlined the importance of choosing a suitable impedance function and it can be observed that a large variety of functions are applied. Commonly used functions are power, negative exponential, logistic and Gaussian functions [@iacono2010; @lowry2012assessment; @vasconcelos2012evaluation; @vale2017influence]. More recently Vale and Pereira (2017) conducted a study testing 20 pedestrian accessibility measures and identified the modified Gaussian and exponential function as the most robust ones for modeling walking accessibility. Cumulative opportunities (also known as isochrones or contour measures), measures count the number of opportunities within a defined catchment area.

Gravity-based measure derived from the gravity model's denominator and weighted opportunities according to an impedance function, which is given by the following expression: [@vale2016active]:

$$
A_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\ W^ \theta_{ij} f(c_{ij})}
$$ {#eq-gravity-measures}

This equation gives the accessibility from the origin location i, W_j are relevant opportunities found at j, f(c\_{ij}) is the cost of moving between i and j. Function f() defines a kernel around location i. Activity-based measures are useful when opportunities are complementary (e.g., jobs, people, services, parks) and when access to more opportunities and being closer (with gravity-based models) is advantageous.

Cumulative opportunities (also known as isochrones or contour measures), measures count the number of opportunities within a defined catchment area. In contrast to the utility measure, which measures accessibility by the 'net utility' from travel, the cumulative measure represents accessibility with the total number of opportunities. This measure counts both the number of reachable opportunities and the associated travel costs.

$$
A_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\ W_{j} f(c_{ij})}
$$ {#eq-cumulative-measure}

in a cumulative measure the distance decay function is binary: $$
f(c_{ij} \le \gamma _i) =
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } c_{ij} \le \gamma _i \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-impedance-function_cumulative_accessibility}

In @eq-impedance-function_cumulative_accessibility \gamma is the threshold value. According to this formula, all opportunities located within the \gamma threshold are considered accessible. In addition, f(c) is an indicator function that returns 1 if the logical statement in the function's argument is true (i.e. if the cost of reaching j from i does not exceed the bandwidth parameter value) and 0 otherwise. Other distance-decay functions (for example, inverse distance or negative exponential) generate smoother map patterns [@o2003aggregate], but they require more parameters and introduce distance- (or cost-) discounted schemes that are more difficult to interpret. Previous research has shown that cumulative opportunity measures are highly correlated regardless of the distance-decay function used [@kwan1998], and we ultimately prefer simplicity and interpretability in our accessibility indicator selection.

##### Distance-based measures

Distance-based measures consider accessibility in terms of proximity, either by travel distance, time, or a generalized cost measure between locations. A distance measure analyses the closest facilities, including 1) distance to the closest opportunity, 2) the number of opportunities within a defined distance or time, 3) the mean distance to all opportunities, and 4) the mean distance to a defined number of closest opportunities [@apparicio2008comparing]. These measures are applicable when destinations are regarded as substitutes for one another (i.e., hospitals, transit stops, convenience stores etc.), under the assumption that individuals want to access the nearest facility.

Distance is considered as the travel impedance and four types of distances are usually used in distance-based accessibility measures: 1) Euclidean distance, that has been mainly used for walkability measures, particularly in health studies [@apparicio2008comparing]. 2) Manhattan distance, 3) shortest network distance [@lundberg2012accessibility; @hochmair2015assessment] 4) shortest network time [@pearce2006neighbourhoods; @paez2012]. As well, there are two different ways for measuring distance, first calculates the distance to the closest facility of each type. The first method calculates the distance from each zone centroid to the closest or the first n closest facilities (e.g. medical centers).and second, calculates the distance to all facilities close by. This approach is based on floating catchment areas that finds the closest facility regardless of distance and measures the distance from each zone centre to the closest or the first n closest different facilities (e.g. medical centres, shopping centres, etc.).

Distance to nearest location is calculated based on @eq-distance-based-accessibility:

$$
A ^ {ip} = (d_{ij}) ^ {MIN} _ {j \epsilon L ^ p}
$$ {#eq-distance-based-accessibility}

In this equation, $A ^ {ip}$ is accessibility of zone i to location of type p, $L ^ p$ is set of locations of type p, and $(d_{ij})$ is distance (or travel time for a given mode) from i to location j in set $L_𝑝$. This measure is consistent with an extremely simple location model in which the nearest location is always chosen with probability 1.0. (2)

$$
P ^ {ip} _j = 
\begin{cases}
 1 & \text{if } d_{ij} = (d_{ij}) ^ {MIN} _ {j \epsilon L ^ p}\\
 0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-distance-based-measure}

In equation 2, $P_j^{ip}$ is the probability of choosing location j for purpose p given that one is located in zone i. This measure has two limitations, first, doesn't consider the size/attractiveness of locations and second, doesn't investigate the cumulative effect of multiple accessible locations. So, it is not recommended to calculate accessibility using this method as an independent measure.

##### Topological or infrastructure-based measures

Topological-based measures consider accessibility in terms of the street network, rather than access from origins to destinations. Topology measures may evaluate network connectivity, the quality of infrastructure within a catchment area, or some combination of connectivity and infrastructure quality. Indeed, this measure emphasizes on infrastructure evaluation. Such approaches are applicable in the context of planning -- for example, in identifying priorities for development, or identifying potential impacts of redevelopment.

There are three types of topological measures: the first group evaluates the level of service (LOS) within a floating catchment area (FCA)[@sisson2006suitability]. The second type is similar the first one. however, this one used a pre-defined spatial unit to evaluate LOS, and this is based on the segment instead of the point [@emery2011wabsa; @horacek2012sneakers; @lowry2012assessment]. The third one is very different, since traffic is not considered as a relevant parameter [@hoedl2010bikeability; @zielstra2011comparative; @jabbari2021accessibility]. These measures are based on and the evaluation of network segments, infrastructure characteristics, and include variables such as sidewalk or bike path availability, quality, and length among others.

##### Utility-based measures

Utility-based measures evaluate accessibility based on individual preferences and the log-sum of discrete choice models applied to destination choice analysis [@ben2021disaggregate]. This measure, which is known as benefit measure, can better represent individual accessibility than location-based measures. In addition, individual-based accessibility yields more representative measures than placed-based accessibility and reflects population access. It is a common method of aggregating accessibility [@geurs2003evaluation; @wachs1973physical].

Utility-based measure can be calculated using two methods:

1.  Assume that a decision-maker perceives the utility of a destination as: $𝑈_𝑗 = 𝑉_𝑗 + 𝜀_𝑗$ where $𝜀_𝑗$ is the individual's idiosyncratic deviation in terms of how s/he perceives the utility of alternative j relative to the population average utility, $𝑉_𝑗$. The person chooses the alternative that generates the maximum perceived utility, $𝑈_𝑗$. Under very common assumptions, the probability that j is the maximum utility alternative and so is chosen is given by the multinomial logit (MNL) model[@train2009discrete]:

$$
P_j ^ {ip} = \frac{e ^ {V_j}}{\sum_{j'\epsilon L ^ {ip}} e ^ {V_j'}} = \frac{e ^ {\beta z _j}}{\sum_{j'\epsilon L ^ {ip}} e^{\beta z_j}}
$$ {#eq-utility-based-measure}

In this equation, ${𝑉_𝑗} = β{Z_j}$: The systematic utility of alternative j; ${Z_j}$ is a Vector of explanatory variables and Β is a (Row) vector of parameters.

2.  The actual perceived maximum utility is unobservable, but, for the case of the MNL model, it can be shown [@ben1985discrete] that the expected maximum utility $(𝐼^{𝑖𝑝})$ associated with this choice is given by @eq-maximum-utility:

$$
I ^{𝑖𝑝} = E [MAX _j(U_j)] = \ln(\sum_{j \epsilon L^ {ip}} e ^ (\beta {z_j})
$$ {#eq-maximum-utility}

That is, it is the natural logarithm of the denominator of the logit choice model (sometimes referred to as the "logsum" term). Further, it can also be shown that this expected maximum utility is the consumer's surplus for this choice. Thus it is a standard measure of economic benefit. Given this, Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) argue that it also provides a behaviorally and economically sound definition of accessibility: accessibility for a given activity is the expected utility that would be derived from participation in this activity, which is also the consumer surplus associated with this participation. That is:

$$
A^{p}_i = \ln \Big(\sum_{j\epsilon L^ {ip}} e ^ {\beta {z_j}}\Big)
$$ {eq-accessibility-maximum-utility}

In the following, Tables 1 and 2 have categorized recent studies based on the accessibility by walking and cycling. However, Vale et al. (2016) found relatively few studies examining cycling-specific accessibility in comparison to walking. For a comprehensive review of all 84 papers on walking and cycling accessibility (published by September 2013) refer to Vale et al. (2016).

##### Walkability measures

Walkability indices can be defines based on the both the social and physical environment, a predictive indicator of active travel and physical activity to access facilities; based on indicator of the usability of the built environment to people [@frank2004obesity; @frank2006many] who walk to different destinations and for different purposes (i.e., from a clear origin to a clear set of destinations) [@saelens2008built; @blevcic2015walkability; @vale2016active; @dovey2020walkability]. There is a difference between gravity- and distance-based accessibility measures and the walkability index so that for measuring walkability, area characteristics around the origins and destinations are also taken into account in the calculation, but still, this index does not consider route characteristics.

Walkability measures are divided into 4 categories including Frank's Walkability Index, Walk score, Objective Walkability Index (OWI), and Graz Walkability Index. In the Frank's index, a walkability score is calculated by summing the normalized scores across factors that are identified based on a definition of the concept of walkability. This index uses residential density, land use mix, retail floor area ratio, and intersection density as variables to measure walkability. Then Grasser, Van Dyck et al. (2013) improved Frank's index for assessing Europe cities by considering population density, household density, and entropy index for land-use mix, and three-way intersection density in order to construct the Graz walkability index [@grasser2013objectively]. In addition, some other theory-based methods such as Objective Walkability Index (OWI) are also proposed. Weiss, Maantay et al. (2010) constructed the OWI, which includes street connectivity, land use mix, pedestrian safety, neighborhood aesthetics, neighborhood safety, and neighborhood infrastructure[@weiss2010promoting]. In 2011, Duncan, Aldstadt et al. (2011) developed Walk Score for measuring walkability of neighborhoods. Indeed, Walk Score recognizes eight types of walking attractors: Errands, Culture, Grocery, Park, Dining and Drinking, School, and Shopping. Walk Score can be assessed for any location worldwide, however, locations outside the US, Canada, Australia, and new zealand should be additionally validated, since the geolocated data is not always complete [@duncan2011validation; WalkScore 2020].

Most of the studies assessed walkability using two Frank's index and walk score [@frank2005linking; @frank2006many; @frank2010development; @vale2016active]. The major difference between these approaches is that Walk Score uses a gravity-based methodology. Opportunities are weighted using a distance decay function, while the Walkability Index is based on a cumulative opportunities measure. In the following, Table 3 provides a summary of this categorization.

##### Bikeability measures

Bikeability can be defined as the ability of a person to bike or the ability of the urban landscape to be biked or as a baseline definition of the likelihood that individuals or groups of people will choose the bicycle as a mode of transport or leisure [@krizek2009explaining; @winters2013mapping; @nielsen2018bikeability] .However, It should be noted that the bikeability index described by several scientists: in 2012, Lowry, Callister et al explained the Bikeability index as the comfort and convenience of an entire bikeway network for accessing important destinations. Then they referd that this index is the only methodology exclusively dedicated to bicycle travel [@lowry2012assessment]. In additional, The Bikeability Index described by Winters, Brauer et al. (2013)includes the three basic measures, but adds the length of bicycle routes, slope, and the separation from car traffic. Each variable is given a score of 1 to 10, which is then summed to produce the final score [@winters2013mapping].

Explaining the Bikeability of an environment has included the following characteristics:

-   Single principles of the townscape or the infrastructure, such as bicycle tracks, crossings, and parking facilities, which are referred to by Lowry, Callister et al. (2012) as "bicycle suitability"[@lowry2012assessment].

-   Neighbourhoods are delineated based on airline/Euclidean distance rather than network distance [@greenberg2005does; @nielsen2018bikeability]

-   Explicit polygon features generated around specific trajectories of individual respondents -- e.g., as recorded by GPS. Such features can be purely geometric, such as buffers or ellipsoids, or be based on the topology of a transport network [@madsen2014developing; @frank2017international].

-   Connected infrastructures as a functional component of entire towns and urban fabrics [@lowry2012assessment]. According to Lowry, Callister et al. (2012), this is in fact what covers the term "Bikeability". In the following, Table 4 prepares some of the studies that used bikeability index.

## A framework for assessing data sources and needs

For calculating accessibility in active transport mode, multiple data sources are required. Following a review of the relevant literature, it was discovered that various data sources such as Travel data (trips), Users data (Socio-economic and personal data), Origin- destination, Cycling and walking network, Spatial data (boundary, land use, postal code, . . . ), additional data (such as Traffic data, weather data, slope, Level of Traffic Stress, impedance value, speed ) are required in order to determine the accessibility of active transportation.

A particular kind of data management system is a data warehouse. Data warehousing is a topic that includes application tools, architectures, information services, and communication infrastructures to combine information from disparate heterogeneous operational data sources that is valuable for decision-making. This data is collected into a single repository known as a data warehouse, which may be used for direct querying and analysis, and as a source for creating logical data marts focused on particular parts of the organization [@kimball2011data]. Important data for decision making is often retrieved from the organization's data sources, processed (i.e., cleaned and homogenized), and then integrated within a sizable data repository (the data warehouse), in what is known as the ETL (extraction/transform/loading) process [@romero2010framework].Inconsistent data, incompatible data formats, data granularity, and other common problems with distributed heterogeneous information services are covered in the first phase (for instance, see [@zhuge1996strobe]).Regarding the second step, creating the DW necessitates methodologies entirely distinct from those used for operational information systems.In this article, the approach used to design the data warehouse is based on the multidimensional paradigm.The fact/dimension dichotomy serves to distinguish the multidimensional view of data, which is characterized by its representation of data (i.e., the relevant fact) as though it were in an n-dimensional space (with as many axes as dimensions of analysis of interest). This paradigm makes it simple to comprehend and evaluate data illustrating the various angles from which a subject may be examined. As a result, the multidimensional model is appropriate for non-expert users such as knowledge workers (from here on, the data warehouse end-users).The third phase needs for the ability to leverage aggregate navigation [@gupta1995aggregate], complex query optimization [@chaudhuri1994including], advanced indexing strategies [@lomet1990hb], and user-friendly visual user interfaces for OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing) [@chaudhuri1997overview; @colliat1996olap] and data mining [@fayyad1996data].

In this study, the multidimensional data warehouse design and end-user requirements elicitation tasks are supported by a user-centered methodology. Three steps make up the process:

-   First, our method begins by thoroughly examining the data sources to determine, without yet taking requirements into consideration, the multidimensional knowledge they capture (i.e., data likely to be analyzed from a multidimensional point of view).

-   Second, we suggest using this knowledge to aid in the work of needs elicitation. By doing this, we are able to fully utilize the sources' analytical skills while already balancing requirements with the data sources.

-   Third, once the requirements are established, we automatically generate the data warehouse conceptual schema and the multidimensional knowledge extracted from the sources.

## Data needs and sources

A one of the existing data sources that can be utilized for data needs is the household travel survey, which has been conducted in various regions throughout Canada. This survey provides access to relevant data pertaining to travel, users, and origin-destination, which are essential for calculating accessibility measures accurately. The household travel survey is a valuable resource for transportation planners, policymakers, and researchers who seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of travel behavior patterns and the factors that influence them. In a household travel survey, several variables are collected such as household levels, person level for each person in the household, and trip level for each trip made by each household member. The General Social Survey (GSS) is another data source that can be utilized at the national level to extract information on travel behavior. The GSS is a comprehensive survey that collects data on a range of topics, including transportation and travel patterns, social trends, and attitudes. The survey is conducted regularly by Statistics Canada.

The following is an overview of the categories of data that are obtained through the households travel surveys:

# General social survey (GSS)

The General Social Survey (GSS) is a ***national*** survey conducted by Statistics Canada that collects information on the social trends and attitudes of Canadians. The survey has been conducted since 1985 and is conducted every two years, making it one of the longest-running surveys of its kind in Canada. This Survey (GSS) in Canada covers a wide range of topics related to social trends and attitudes. Some of the major topics covered by the survey include:Social well-being, Health, Education, Work, Family, Social networks, Crime and justice, and Time use. The survey is designed to provide a snapshot of social trends and attitudes in Canada, and is used by researchers, policy-makers, and the general public to gain a better understanding of the social issues facing Canadians.

The Time Use Survey is a component of the General Social Survey (GSS) that has been conducted since 1986.This survey is conducting every 5 years (1986, 1992, 1998, 2005, and 2015) and continued until 2020. However, the information related to the 2020 census has not been released yet. So, The most recent survey was released in 2015. It is designed to provide information on how Canadians allocate their time on a daily basis activities such as paid work, household chores, leisure activities, caregiving activities, and travel trips.

# Transportation Tomorrow Survey survey (TTS)

The Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) is a comprehensive survey (a series of population-based cross sectional travel surveys) that gathers information about how and where people travel. The survey aims to gather detailed information about the travel patterns of households and individuals.Since 1986, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has been implementing the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) program every five years, which has proven to be a highly effective means of collecting data on travel behavior. The Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) are parts of an ongoing data collection program by the Transportation Information Steering Committee (TISC). The survey data (2016, 2011, 2006, 2001, 1996, 1991 and 1986) are currently under the care of the Data Management Group. This group is responsible for maintaining the TTS databases and making available appropriate travel information for any urban transportation study in the area.

In 1986, the survey covered the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), which included the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and the Regional Municipalities of Durham, York, Peel, Halton, and Hamilton. In 1991, the survey area was expanded to include the municipalities adjacent to the GTHA boundary, known as the 'fringe area.' The 1996 survey included all of the GTHA, plus several additional regions, including Peterborough County, City of Peterborough, Victoria County, Town of Orangeville, Simcoe County, City of Barrie, Wellington County, City of Guelph, Waterloo Region, and Niagara Region. In 2001, the survey area changed again, with the addition of the whole of Simcoe County, the City of Orillia, and the exclusion of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo and Northumberland County. The 2006 survey area included the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, the City of Brantford, and Dufferin County, with interviews conducted in Brant County during interviewer training. The survey area in the 2011 and 2016 TTS was the same as in 2006, with the inclusion of Brant County.

TTS database includes ***Household attributes*** (such as Regional municipality of household, geocode of household, UTM X and Y coordinate of the household, Type of dwelling unit, Number of persons in the household, Day of week trip data, Number of vehicles, Number of persons possessing a driver's licence in the household, Number of full or part time workers in the household, Number of full or part time students in the household, Number of household trips on trip day, and Household's total income), ***Person attributes*** (such as person number within the household, age, gender, possession of a driver's licence, possession of a transit pass, employment status of the person, person's occupation type, student status of person, school codes (Starting from 2001), regional/Local municipality of person's usual place of work, UTM X and Y coordinate of person's usual place of work, geocode person's usual place of work, number of trips made by the individual on trip day, and number of trips made by individual on trip day with primary mode being public transit), ***Trip attributes*** (such as trip number for persons in household, start time of the trip, Primary mode of the trip (public transit, bicycle and walking), purpose of the trip (home-based work (i.e. home-to-work or work-to-home), home-based-school, home-based-discretionary, non-Home-based), origin purpose of the trip, Regional municipality of trip origin, planning district of trip origin, 2001 and 2006 traffic zone of trip origin, UTM X and Y coordinate of trip origin, Method used to geocode trip origin, destination purpose of the trip (second and subsequent school trips, daycare (not in 1986), entertainment (1986 only), facilitate passenger, home, linked trip (1991 only), marketing/ Shopping (not in 1991), second and subsequent work trips, first school trip of the day, first work trip of the day and others), regional municipality of trip destination, planning district of trip destination, 2001 and 2006 traffic zone of trip destination, UTM X and Y coordinate of trip destination, method used to geocode trip destination, straight line trip length in kilometres, manhattan distance trip length in kilometres).

The information collected through the TTS provides valuable insights into travel patterns in a given region. It can help transportation planners and policymakers better understand the needs of travelers and make informed decisions about transportation infrastructure and services. By analyzing the data collected through the TTS, planners can identify trends and patterns in travel behavior, such as the most popular modes of transportation and the busiest travel times, and use this information to develop more effective transportation policies and programs.

# Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain survey (ARTM)

The Montreal OD (Origin-Destination) survey is a large-scale cross-sectional household travel survey conducted every five years since 1970 in the Montreal metropolitan area (1970, 1974, 1978, 1982,1987, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018). The survey covers 5% of the population residing in the Montreal metropolitan area and is conducted by the Autorité Régionale de Transport Métropolitain (ARTM).

Its purpose is to provide an accurate picture of all the trips made by residents of the region during an average weekday, for all modes of transportation used such as walking, cycling, bus, metro, train, and car. They are descriptive surveys that provide a statistical portrait of the different characteristics of people's trips. For each documented trip, the surveys identify the origin, destination, purpose, departure time, and all the different modes of transport used. Other socio-demographic variables are also collected. This is primarily a survey conducted through telephone interviews that aims to provide a general overview of all trips made by residents of the region, regardless of the mode of transport used. For the first time, the 2018 OD survey included a web questionnaire component. In addition, this survey cover an increasingly larger territory that spans the entire metropolitan region, from the major cities of Montreal, Laval, and Longueuil, to the north and south crowns.

The survey collects detailed information on each trip made by all individuals in ***each surveyed household*** (such as home location, size,vehicle ownership, and number of cars), **each person in the household** (age, gender,income,education level, driving license ownership, main occupation, public transit monthly pass ownership), and **each trip** made by each person of 5 years and older ( such as departure time, origin and destination locations, trip purpose, mode sequence, and others).

# Can-BICS

-   Cycling and walking networks

Can-BICS is a classification system of five broad bicycle facilities assigned to three categories: high, medium, and low comfort, based on the facility's contribution to user safety and comfort while cycling. 1) High comfort includes low-stress routes that are comfortable for most people, including those of all ages and abilities, with a record for best safety. for example, cycle track, local street bikeway, and bike path. 2) medium comfort is low- or medium-stress routes that are comfortable for some people, but whose safety requires careful design, such as multi-use paths (A two-way paved path shared by cyclists, pedestrians and other users). 3) low comfort bikeways are high-stress routes that are comfortable for few people, with little or no additional safety, compared to no bicycle facility, such as painted bike lanes that are designated by bicycle and diamond pavement markings and signs as exclusively for cyclists. And 4) non-conforming bicycle facilities do not meet minimum Can-BICS standards, such as non-conforming - trail (these are multi-use trails with unpaved surface), non-conforming -- major road (shared lanes on major roads provide connectivity), and non-conforming - other.

# OpenStreetMap (OSM)

-   Cycling and walking networks

Another source for obtaining cycling and walking networks is OpenStreetMap (OSM). This dataset is a collaborative global map that using for active transportation researches. OSM considered cycle lanes, tracks and sidewalks. A cycle lane lies within the roadway itself (on-road), whereas a cycle track is separate from the road (off-road). Tracks are typically separated from the road by e.g. curbs, parking lots, grass verges, trees, etc. as well, trails line that indicates the paths or routes suitable for walking, hiking, bicycling, and other outdoor activities from 2015 to 2019 can be obtained from scholars Geoportal.

# Municipal open data

Municipal open data is a standard source of bicycling infrastructure data that city governments are making this spatial data for bicycling infrastructure. In Canada, some cities have this dataset such as Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, etc. However, open data of different cities use different definitions for bicycling infrastructure, and they may have different levels of timeliness, completeness, and documentation [@schoner2014missing]. For example, bicycle facilities the City of Toronto Open Data portal consists of a high-resolution geospatial data set with attributes accumulated from several sources of cycle tracks or bike lanes, road classification (local, collector, minor arterial, etc.), number of lanes, directions, stop signs and signalized intersections. (City of Toronto, 2017).

## Important considerations and possible challenges

**Travel time/distance thresholds**

Selecting an appropriate cut-off distance for travel has been acknowledged as an important step that has the potential to significantly impact results. Different distance thresholds should apply to both cycling and walking, however, there remains considerable variation among the threshold values applied within each mode.

Some analyses choose to vary thresholds according to the destination type, or by population group. For example, Saghapour (2017) use a 10-minute travel time for retail and recreation centres and a 20-minute travel time for cycling to community services[@saghapour2017measuring]. Applying the same threshold to all age groups also disregards the fact that certain groups (for example, seniors and children) may travel slower or require greater effort to travel the same distance. Although applicable to both cycling and walking, this distinction by age group has only been applied among walking measures. In the following, Tables 7 shows the thresholds of bicycle and walking travel time and distance in different studies.

**Impedance functions**

Impedance function is used to describe willingness of cyclists and pedestrian to travel to a destination as a function of cost (distance, time, etc.); it is a component of accessibility [@iacono2010; @yang2012walking; @arranz2019]. The impedance function obtained by fitting to a real dataset provides a continuous description of cycling and walking probability at different costs. The spatial distribution of bicycle and pedestrian travel can be expressed using distance decay functions [@iacono2010] as travel distance is a limiting factor for implementing use[@larsen2011travel]. Distance decay functions describe the effect of distance on spatial interactions and typically express distance as a function of travel impedance (time or cost). Rybarczyk and Wu (2010) identified the importance of the spatial patterns of bicycle facilities and connectivity of a local network when studying accessibility. Furthermore, increased connectivity within a network also allows for increased accessibility[@rybarczyk2010bicycle].

Some researchers have argued that -- like maximum travel thresholds -- distance-decay rates should differ according to trip purpose and different population groups [@garcia2013walking; @wu2019measuring]. Similarly, researchers also argue that walking and cycling impedance functions should be calculated separately due to their differing travel speeds and maximum travel ranges [@cheng2019investigating]. For example, the distance-decay curve for work trips shown in Figure 1 assumes that cyclists are half as likely to reach a work destination 20 minutes away than one 10 minutes away, and therefore, any jobs 20 minutes away would be applied half the weight of jobs 10 minutes away. These cycling weights differ slightly from walking trips since fewer people are willing to walk a longer distance to work. While adjusting the distance-decay functions by mode has the potential to improve accuracy, it can also be said that a consistent approach to measuring accessibility across modes is preferable due to the possibility of causing one mode seem less accessible when applying different decay functions (State Smart Transportation Initiative, 2021).

In terms of the types of impedance functions considered, a negative exponential curve is common (@saghapour2017measuring; @wu2019measuring\] -- example shown in Figure 1. However, some studies have also calculated study-specific distance-decay curves based on trip data rather than assuming a standard function. Wu, Lu et al. (2019) calculated a distance-decay function using data from Shenzhen's dockless bicycle-sharing system. Their findings show that a lognormal distance decay best fit the distribution of bike-sharing trips, with the willingness to cycle increasing up to \~500m and decreasing thereafter. García-Palomares, Gutiérrez et al. (2013) took a similar approach for measuring walking accessibility to metro stations and found a linear distance-decay trend that varied significantly by age [@garcia2013walking; @wu2019measuring].

**Slope**

One of the factors associated with the natural environment and has an effect on bicycle and walking trips is slope. hence, pedestrians and cyclists will travel out of their way to by-pass segments with steep slopes. because, For them, small positive increments in slope decrease travel speeds while increasing energy use and travel time. Besides, due to the differences in efforts to go up-slope versus down-slope, pedestrians and cyclists may not select the same way. This is referred to as anisotropic movement [@ebener2005physical].

There are few studies that have considered slope in measures of active accessibility, yet it is acknowledged as an important factor to include since people will often avoid routes with significant elevation gain, and routes with steep slopes may significantly impact accessibility. Often, network analyst tools use the shortest path from the road network, which may not reflect actual cycling or walking behavior. Vale, Saraiva et al. (2015) concluded that slope should always be included in accessibility of bicycling and that it is also important for walking, however it is largely absent from walking accessibility measures [@vale2016active]. However, the greater availability of elevation data and advances in research in various disciplines offer opportunities to better understand the behavior of individuals when travelling in infrastructure-poor contexts and challenge assumptions surrounding the most important costs to be minimized. Papa, Carpentieri et al. (2018) also highlighted a significant difference in catchment areas when including versus excluding the slope attribute (\~33% km2 difference for adults over 75) [@papa2018measuring]. Wood, Jones et al. (2018) studied the sensitivity in distance calculation to variations in three travel-time modeling approaches, taking as reference a model that accounted for variations in land cover and directionality in slope (anisotropy). They found that an approach based on measuring Euclidean distances on a flat surface underestimated the distance traveled, relative to the reference. The second approach, which calculated the distances constrained to a road network, also varied substantially from the reference, underestimating it in some areas and overestimating in others. Finally, the third approach, which accounted for land cover and elevation but ignored the directionality of slopes slightly underestimated travel times [@wood2018pedestrian].

Lundberg (2012) examined the local cycling and walking networks through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using accessibility. They extracted a percent slope raster layer from DEM layer that was obtained from part of the National Elevation Dataset (NED). the percent slope of the DEM ranged from 0 to 360. In Arc Map, when the slope angle equals 45 degrees, the rise is equal to the run. Expressed as a percentage, the slope of this angle is 100%. As the slope angle approaches vertical (90o), the percentage slope approaches infinity. An X,Y coordinate was first calculated for the start point of each line segment. Next an X,Y coordinate was calculated for the end point of each line segment. Arc Map's 3D Analyst extension was used to convert the street network into a 3D layer, at which point percent slope could then be calculated as the Z-value for each of the line segments in the network. A Z-value (elevation) was calculated at the start points and end points of each line segment. The following equation was used to derive percent slope for each line segment: $$
(\frac{(End_z) - (Start_z)}{[(Start_x) - (End_x)] + [(Start_y) - (End_y)] ^ 2}) ^ {0.5} * 100
$$ slope values indicate uphill travel while negative slope values indicate downhill travel. In this regard, they proposed different walking and cycling speeds based on the different slopes using Parkin and Rotheram (2010) findings on the impact of slope on bicycle travel speeds[@parkin2010design].Table 8. summarizes the various bicycle travel speeds used in the GIS modeling.

| **Slope** | **Speed(mph)** |

|    -10    |      18.8      |
|    -7     |      17.1      |
|    -5     |      16.1      |

Pedestrian travel speeds were also calculated based on the effect of slope. Tobler's hiking function was used to identify the effect of slope on travel speed. The following equation represents the modified Tobler's formula adjusted for percent slope:

$$
V = 6 e ^ {-3.5 |s+0.05|}
$$

Where v is velocity, e is the base for natural logarithms, and s is the slope in percent. Table 9. summarizes a pedestrian's travel speed used in the modeling in GIS.

| **Slope** | **Speed(mph)** |
|:---------:|:--------------:|
|    10     |      1.6       |
|    7.5    |      2.1       |
|     5     |      2.4       |
|    2.5    |      2.8       |
|     0     |      3.1       |
|   -2.5    |      3.6       |
|    -5     |      3.1       |
|   -7.5    |      2.6       |
|    -10    |      2.3       |

In another study, Paez et al (2020) calculated the slope from the vertical and horizontal displacements. The instantaneous slope (m) is given by the derivative of $y = f(x)$ with respect to x. this is given by the following expression [@paez2020]:

$$
m = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta h}
$$

In a DEM layer, two physical aspects of the landscape that relate to resistance can be obtained directly from the grid, namely the vertical displacement and the horizontal displacement between nodes i and j. $\Delta V$ and \$\Delta h \$ are vertical and/or horizontal displacements respectively. This slope is linked to speed via Tobler's formula for hiking travel [@tobler1993three]:

$$
S = 100 e ^ {(-3.5 |m+0.5|)}
$$ where the speed s is in m/min. The amount of speed can be converted into travel time in minutes if it is divided the distance by speed as follows:

$$
t = \frac{d_i}{100 e ^ {(-3.5 |m+0.5|)}} = \frac{1}{100} * {d_i}e ^ {(-3.5 |m+0.5|)}
$$

where $d_i$ can be the distance on the surface as discussed above or can be approximated by the horizontal distance $\Delta h$. As seen in Fig. 2, travel time tends to increase as the slope in creases.

![Figure 2: Relationship between surface distance/travel time and slope](images/Fig.2.jpg)

**Weather**

Other factors that are associated with the natural environment and have also been shown to affect cycling and walking trips are as follows: weather, temperature, shade, and aesthetics. The type of weather an individual has to travel through has been identified as a principal factor in the decision process for employing non-motorized travel modes. The pinnacle conditions that individuals consider using non-motorized travel include dry weather and pleasant temperatures (60 to 75) [@zacharias2001pedestrian]. High amounts of shade cover over a network and available aesthetics along a route increase the rates for non-motorized travel [@zahran2008cycling].

**Level of Traffic Stress**

Several of the cycling accessibility approaches incorporate bicycle infrastructure using level of traffic stress (LTS) [@imani2019cycle; @murphy2019implementing]. The LTS method was first proposed by Furth, Mekuria et al. (2016) to categorize street segments into 4 categories based on the number of lanes, presence of a parking lane, the speed limit, the bike lane and parking lane width, and any bike lane blockage [@furth2016network].Faghih Imani et al. (2019) and Murphy and Owen (2019) compare cycling accessibility measures using different LTS categorizes to calculate service areas. Both studies exclude highways and high-volume roads from the network and classify into LTS categories using attribute information available from the network dataset and used the City of Toronto open data and OSM data respectively[@imani2019cycle; @murphy2019implementing].

The Canadian Bikeway Comfort and Safety (Can-BICS) Classification System aims to provide a common nomenclature for bicycle facilities based on user safety and comfort. The Can-BICS classification designates bicycling facilities into three categories: high, medium, and low comfort infrastructure. There is some general alignment between Can-BICS categories and LTS criteria, however, there are a few main differences:

Local street bikeways are classified as high comfort using Can-BICS, but either LTS 1 or 2 depending on the number of lanes.

Painted bike lanes may be assigned LTS 1 to 4 depending on the speed, width, and presence of parking lanes, whereas in Can-BICS, painted lanes are low comfort facilities.

Trails and walkways in parks are LTS 1 but may be categorized as non-conforming Can-BICS facilities depending on the trail surface (e.g., gravel or dirt vs. paved).

|    **Facility Type**     | **Can-BICS Class** | **LTS Category** |
|:------------------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|
|       Cycle tracks       |    High comfort    |        1         |
|   Local street bikeway   |    High comfort    |      1 or 2      |
|        Bike paths        |    High comfort    |        1         |
|     Multi-use paths      |   Medium comfort   |        1         |
|    Painted Bike lanes    |    Low comfort     |      1 to 4      |
| Park trails and walkways |   Non-conforming   |        1         |

**Origins/destinations & applying weights**

Typically, the way in which opportunities are measured depends on the type of opportunity and whether one or multiple opportunity types are considered. For example, the studies measuring job accessibility or number of people served by transit consider a total count, whereas for urban park access, Reyes et al. (2014) and Cheng et al. (2019) consider cell counts to account for park area[@reyes2014walking; @cheng2019investigating]. Among walkability and bikeability indices it is also common to apply weights to the variables depending on the goals for analysis [@frank2010development; @vale2016active; @arellana2021walk].

The majority of studies focus on origin-based accessibility (access to destinations), however, as argued by Vale et al. (2015), accessibility at destinations is also important. For example, individuals may reside in high accessible areas, but work in low-accessibility areas. In this respect, topology-based measures, may be preferred, or it may be useful to consider accessibility in terms of the population served around destinations of interest[@vale2016active].

## Summary

Overall, there remains considerable variation in the types of accessibility measures applied in the context of walking and cycling. Among the four main types of active accessibility measures identified, the majority of recent studies use an activity-based approach, either measuring cumulative opportunities (within a catchment area / weighted by distance from the origin) or measuring gravity models. The activity-based approaches mainly vary in terms of the travel time and distance thresholds, and weighting impedance functions considered.

Many of the walking approaches, for instance, aim to incorporate a variable walking threshold (depending on age or location), while this is not seen within the context of cycling -- where a prioritization of measures by route infrastructure is more apparent. Conversely, attention to infrastructure type, or comfort and safety, is not seen among pedestrian-focused studies.

When selecting an accessibility measure, there is evidently a trade-off between complexity and measure interpretability. While adding more complexity or multiple indices for different population groups, may increase accuracy, a simple, and easy to implement measure may be more important for widespread use.

## Discussion

Eliciting user needs data is the process of discovering requirements for a project by accessing available knowledge sources, and by communicating with the stakeholders who have a direct or indirect influence on the requirements.Among the available requirements elicitation technique, the most common and effective elicitation techniques is interviews with stakeholders[@engelbrektsson2000eliciting; @browne2001empirical; @friedrich2007towards; @hadar2014role].As a result, in this section, we discuss some of the questions required to extract data users' requirements.
